# Example Card File

This is an example card file which is designed to show some of the features of ZenKat (including planned future features). It can also be seen as a collection of tips for organising a plaintext Zennkasten from my own experience.

## Links

zenkat now supports [normal markdown links](notes/chapter-1) and wiki-style links like [[notes/chapter-1]].

## Current Todos

Todos aren't treated in a special way yet, but they might be in the future.

- [ ] This is a todo item
- [x] This is a checked todo item
- [ ] This one has children 
  - [ ] Child A
  - [ ] Child B
  - [ ] Child C
- [ ] When todo items get too long and unwieldy it may be helpful to link them to a separate document. [[notes/chapter-1]]
